# Module 5: Discrete and Hybrid Systems

## Introduction

In this module, we are focusing on Discrete and Hybrid Systems in automotive applications. This module builds upon the continuous-time modeling concepts we've explored in previous modules and introduces you to the world of discrete-time and hybrid system modeling in Modelica.

In automotive engineering, many systems combine continuous dynamics with discrete events or decision-making processes. Examples include:

- Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS)
- Traction Control Systems
- Engine Control Units (ECUs)
- Adaptive Cruise Control

Understanding how to model and simulate these systems is crucial for modern automotive development. This module will equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively model discrete and hybrid systems using Modelica.

## Module Overview

This module covers the following topics:

1. [Discrete-time modeling](discrete-time-modeling.md)
2. [Events and when clauses](events-and-when-clauses.md)
3. [Hybrid system modeling](hybrid-system-modeling.md)
4. [State machines in Modelica](state-machines-modelica.md)

Each topic includes theoretical explanations, practical examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Completed the previous modules in the Modelica Lab project
- A solid understanding of continuous-time modeling in Modelica
- OpenModelica 1.23.1 installed on your system (we're using Ubuntu 22.04)

## Getting Started

To begin, click on the links for each subtopic above. Each page contains detailed explanations, examples, and exercises. We recommend following the order presented, as each topic builds on the concepts introduced in the previous ones.

> **Tip**: As you work through the examples, try to modify and experiment with the code. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of the concepts.

Happy learning, and enjoy your journey into the world of discrete and hybrid systems modeling in Modelica!
