# 2. Modelica Language Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the Modelica Language Basics module of the Modelica Lab project! This module is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and structures of the Modelica language, with a focus on automotive applications. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of Modelica's syntax, data types, equations, algorithms, and more. Let's dive in!

## 2.1. Basic Syntax and Structure

Modelica uses a clear and intuitive syntax that allows for easy model creation and understanding. Let's explore the basic structure of a Modelica model.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Model Declaration**: Models in Modelica typically start with the `model` keyword, followed by the model name.
2. **Class Keyword**: Modelica also uses the `class` keyword, which is more general than `model`.
3. **Sections**: A typical model contains sections for parameter declarations, component instantiations, and equations.
4. **End Statement**: Every model or class ends with an `end` statement followed by the model or class name.

### Difference between `model` and `class`:

### Example:

```modelica
model SimpleSpring
  // Model content...
end SimpleSpring;

class GenericVehicle
  // Class content...
end GenericVehicle;
```

- `model` is a specialized class that is used for creating physical models. It has some restrictions and defaults that make it suitable for equation-based modeling.
- `class` is more general and can be used to create any type of Modelica entity, including models, functions, or record definitions.

In practice, `model` is used more frequently for physical system modeling, while `class` might be used for more abstract or general-purpose definitions.

### Example:

```modelica
model SimpleSpring
  // Parameter declarations
  parameter Real k = 100 "Spring constant (N/m)";
  parameter Real m = 1 "Mass (kg)";
  
  // Variable declarations
  Real x "Position (m)";
  Real v "Velocity (m/s)";
  Real a "Acceleration (m/s^2)";
  
equation
  // Equations defining the system behavior
  der(x) = v;
  der(v) = a;
  m*a + k*x = 0;
end SimpleSpring;
```

In this example, we define a simple spring-mass system. Notice how the model is structured with clear sections for parameters, variables, and equations.

> **Tip**: Always use meaningful names for your models, parameters, and variables. This improves readability and makes your models easier to understand and maintain.

## 2.2. Data Types and Variables

Modelica supports various data types to represent different kinds of information in your models.

### Key Data Types:

1. **Real**: For continuous real numbers (e.g., `Real position = 0;`)
2. **Integer**: For whole numbers (e.g., `Integer count = 5;`)
3. **Boolean**: For true/false values (e.g., `Boolean isActivated = false;`)
4. **String**: For text data (e.g., `String componentName = "Engine";`)

### Variable Attributes:

Variables in Modelica can have attributes that provide additional information:

- `start`: Initial value
- `fixed`: Whether the start value is fixed
- `min` and `max`: Allowed range of values
- `unit`: Physical unit of the variable

### Example:

```modelica
model EngineParameters
  parameter Real maxTorque(unit="N.m") = 200 "Maximum engine torque";
  parameter Integer cylinderCount = 4 "Number of engine cylinders";
  Real currentRPM(start=0, min=0, max=8000) "Current engine RPM";
  Boolean isRunning(start=false) "Engine running status";
end EngineParameters;
```

This example demonstrates the use of different data types and variable attributes.

## 2.3. Equations and Algorithms

Modelica supports both equation-based and algorithmic modeling. Equations are used for describing physical behaviors, while algorithms are used for step-by-step procedures.

### Equations:

- Defined in the `equation` section
- Acausal (no predetermined input/output)
- Automatically solved by the Modelica tool

### Algorithms:

- Defined in the `algorithm` section
- Causal (sequential execution)
- Useful for complex logic or iterative processes

### The `:=` Operator:

In the `algorithm` section, you use the `:=` operator for assignments (initialization) instead of the `=` sign used in equations. This emphasizes the causal nature of algorithms.

```modelica
model InitializationExample
  Real x;
algorithm
  x := 5;  // Initial assignment to x during initialization phase
end InitializationExample;
```

It can also be used to assign initial values to parameters or variables in a model, but it happens specifically when you want the initialization to occur before simulation starts, not as part of an equation-based assignment.

```modelica
model ParamInitialization
  parameter Real k := 10;  // Initialize parameter k to 10
end ParamInitialization;
```

In contrast, `equations` or expressions using the `=` operator define relationships that are evaluated throughout the simulation.


### Example:

```modelica
model SimpleCar
  parameter Real mass(unit="kg") = 1500 "Vehicle mass";
  parameter Real dragCoeff = 0.3 "Drag coefficient";
  Real velocity(start=0, unit="m/s") "Vehicle velocity";
  Real acceleration(unit="m/s2") "Vehicle acceleration";
  Real force(unit="N") "Total force on vehicle";
  
equation
  // Newton's Second Law
  force = mass * acceleration;
  
  // Simple drag force equation
  force = 1000 - dragCoeff * velocity^2;
  
  // Velocity calculation
  der(velocity) = acceleration;
  
algorithm
  // Simple gear shifting logic
  when velocity > 20 then
    Modelica.Utilities.Streams.print("Shifting to higher gear");
  end when;
end SimpleCar;
```

This example combines equations to model the physical behavior of a car and an algorithm to implement a simple gear-shifting logic.

## 2.4. Functions and Operators

Modelica provides a rich set of built-in operators and allows users to define custom functions.

### Built-in Operators:

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- Comparison: `==`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

### Custom Functions:

Functions in Modelica are defined using the `function` keyword and can have input and output parameters.

### Example:

```modelica
function calculateBrakingDistance
  input Real initialVelocity(unit="m/s");
  input Real brakingAcceleration(unit="m/s2");
  output Real distance(unit="m");
algorithm
  distance := (initialVelocity^2) / (2 * brakingAcceleration);
end calculateBrakingDistance;

model BrakingSystem
  parameter Real initialSpeed = 100/3.6 "Initial speed in m/s";
  parameter Real deceleration = 7 "Braking deceleration in m/s^2";
  Real brakingDistance;
equation
  brakingDistance = calculateBrakingDistance(initialSpeed, deceleration);
  
algorithm
  // Example of using <> operator
  when time > 5 and brakingDistance <> 0 then
    Modelica.Utilities.Streams.print("Braking distance calculated");
  end when;
end BrakingSystem;
```

This example defines a function to calculate braking distance and uses it within a model and demonstrates the use of the `:=` operator in the function's algorithm section and the `<>` operator in the model's algorithm section.

## 2.5. Modelica Standard Library Overview

The Modelica Standard Library (MSL) is a comprehensive collection of pre-built components and models that you can use in your own models.

### Key Libraries for Automotive Applications:

1. **Modelica.Mechanics**: For mechanical systems (MultiBody, Rotational, Translational)
2. **Modelica.Electrical**: For electrical systems
3. **Modelica.Fluid**: For fluid systems (hydraulics, pneumatics)
4. **Modelica.Thermal**: For thermal systems
5. **Modelica.Blocks**: For control systems and signal processing

### Example:

```modelica
model SimpleVehicle
  import Modelica.Mechanics.Translational;
  import Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational;
  
  Translational.Components.Mass vehicleMass(m=1500);
  Translational.Sources.Force drivingForce;
  Rotational.Components.Inertia wheelInertia(J=1);
  Rotational.Sources.Torque engineTorque;
  
  // ... (additional component declarations)
  
equation
  // ... (equations connecting the components)
end SimpleVehicle;
```

This example demonstrates how to use components from the Modelica Standard Library to create a simple vehicle model.
